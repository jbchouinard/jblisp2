# Jibi Scheme

A small tree-walk interpreter for a homebrew dialect of Scheme, implemented in Rust,
for fun and learning.

Inspired by [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/).

jibi does not aim to be a fully-featured standard (RnRS) Scheme language,
Eventually I would like to implement enough features to use jibi to complete
exercises and projects from [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).

Since it is a tree-walk interpreter it is horribly slow, I would to like to
re-implement a future version to run on a bytecode VM instead.

Features:
- First class functions
- Lexical scoping and closures
- Procedural macros
- Reader macros
- Exception handling
- Namespaced modules
- Automatic reference counting
